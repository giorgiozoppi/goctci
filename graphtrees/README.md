# Cracking the code interviews
## Trees and Graphs 
1. Exercise 4.1 (graphnodes)
   - Given a directed graph and two nodes (S and E) design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route between S to E
2. Exercise 4.2 (minimaltree)
   - Given a sorted increasing order array with unique integer elements, write an algorithm to create a binary search tree with minimal height
3. Exercice 4.3 (list of depths)
   - Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linkedlist of all nodes at each depth.
