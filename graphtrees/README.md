## Trees and Graphs 
Exercise 4.1 (graphnodes)
-  Given a directed graph and two nodes (S and E) design an algorithm to find out 
   whether there is a route between S to E
Exercise 4.2 (minimaltree)
- Given a sorted increasing order array with unique integer elements, 
  write an algorithm to create a binary search tree with minimal height
Exercice 4.3 (list of depths)
- Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linkedlist of all nodes
  at each depth.
