# Cracking the code interviews
## Stack and Queues
### Exercise 3.1 (threestack)
-  Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks
### Exercise 3.2 (stackmin)
- How would you design a stack which in addition to push and pop, has a function min which returns the minimun of an element?
### Exercice 3.3 (pilestack)
- Imagine a stack of piles . If the stack gets too high, it might topple. Therefore
in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeeds some
thresold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimic this.
SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the 
previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks push() and pop() should behave identically to
a single stack.
### Exercise 3.4 (doublestack)
Implement a MyQueue class which implements a queue using two stacks.
### Exercise 3.5 (sortedstack)
Write a program to sort a stack such that the smallest items are on the top. You can use
an additional temporary stack, but you may not copy the lements into any other data structure.
The stack suppoers the following operations: push, pop, peek, isEmpty
### Exercise 3.6 (animalshelter)
An animal shelter which holds only dogs and cats, operates on a stricly FIFO order.
People must adopt either the "oldest"  (based on arrival time) of all animals at the 
shelter or they can select which specific animal they would like. Create the data structures
to maintain this system and implement operations such as enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog and 
dequeueCat.
